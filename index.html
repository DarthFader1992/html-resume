            <h2>Work Experience</h2> 
            <b>RGB BALTIC OÜ</b> - More than 10 years working as a sound technician in a well respected rental company. I have served hundreds of conferences and numerous bands. I am used to having to working day or night to get the job done on time.

            <br/>
            
            <h2>Skills</h2>
            As a starting web developer I am only familiar with basic html, but I am willing and eager to learn more.
            I do think that I am good with people. It is hard to get me frustrated and I get on very well with my colleagues and clients. I am polite, but also friendly and helpful. As a sound technician I also have been using english to communicate with foreign artists and their crew or when I have had the chance to work outside Estonia. I know how to program PLCs (programmable logistics controllers), also sound mixers, and some other programs that are needed in modern audio industry. So I am quite confindent I will find some familiar aspects in web development as I have began my journey in that department.
            Father of 3 I know how to keep people with different interest happy and willing to work for a mutually positive result.

            I have participated in different courses from quite a young age. I usually finish what I have started.
